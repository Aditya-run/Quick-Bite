---------Commits and their respective changes----------
1. Implemented splash screen but it didn't seem to work as intended because the default screen appears in the first go then the splash launches but when in AMF.xml, I set the theme to default one, it worked.
2. Implemented retrofit, fonts, dagger and hilt for api calls, textfont and dependency injection.
3. Did the setup of signup screen with animation and other composables, set up its viewmodel. Next is to do the backend setup for signup.
4. In this commit, I have enabled the sign-up functionality and explored various computer networking concepts as applied in this project. Key challenges and learnings at this stage include the need to pass the IP address in the base URL and verify the IP from the phone to establish a successful connection. This step is essential for enabling communication between the client (Android app) and the server (Ktor backend), reflecting how client-server architecture operates in real-world scenarios.
